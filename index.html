      <p>
        PODEY CO-OPRATIVE BANK LIMITED CHANDRAPUR is one the leading bank Since
        1880.A bank is a financial institution where customers can save or
        borrow money. Banks also invest money to build up their reserve of
        money. What they do is regulated by laws. Those laws differ in different
        countries. The people who work at a bank are called bank employees.
        Certain banks deal directly with the public and they are the only ones
        which an ordinary person will deal with. Other banks deal with
        investments and international currency trading.

        <br />

        Customer's money may be placed in the bank for safe keeping. Banks may
        give loans to customers under an agreement to pay the money back to the
        bank at a later time, with interest. An example is getting a mortgage to
        buy a house or apartment. Banks also can use the money they have from
        deposit accounts to invest in businesses in order to make more money.
        <br />
        In most countries the rules for banks are made by the government acting
        through laws. A central bank (such as the Bank of England) adjusts how
        much money is issued at a particular time. This is a factor in the
        economy of a country, and the government takes the big decisions. These
        "banks of issue" take in, and issue out, coins and banknotes.

          The Podey Institute of Technology Since 1990, college is an
          educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be
          a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a
          collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational
          education, or a secondary school. In the United States, "college" may
          refer to a constituent part of a university or to a degree-awarding
          tertiary educational institution, but generally "college" and
          "university" are used interchangeably,[1] whereas in the United
          Kingdom, Oceania, South Asia, Southern Africa, most of Europe and
          Africa, and Canada, "college" may refer to a high school or secondary
          school, a college of further education, a training institution that
          awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not
          have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers),
          or a constituent part of a university (see this comparison of British
          and American English educational terminology for further information).

            Shri Om Prabhakar Podey , Since 24/11 is our founder of Podey Bank as well as P.I.T.In 1954, Ray Kroc is a traveling milkshake machine salesman. While he has a supportive wife named Ethel and has saved enough to live a comfortable life in Arlington Heights, Illinois, he craves more. Ray also observes that many of the drive-in restaurants that he tries to sell to are inefficiently run. After learning that a drive-in in San Bernardino is ordering an unusually large number of milkshake mixers, Ray drives to California to see it. What he finds is McDonald'sâ€”a highly popular walk-up restaurant with fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging and a family-friendly atmosphere.

            Ray meets with the two McDonald brothers, Maurice "Mac" and Richard "Dick" McDonald. They give Ray a tour of the kitchen and he notes the employees' strong work ethic. Ray is astounded with the restaurant, and takes the brothers to dinner. They tell him the origin story
